# Curriculum Vitae

This repository is essentially a static Jekyll-powered website displaying my CV, as well as my publications nicely rendered, modular and extensible. So far, I only use it to generate PDFs from those two pages and keep the repo private, but one day I might change that.

## Running the static site

To run it, simply execute

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then, Jekyll will display a local URL that shows the static website. This displays the `index.html` by default, which is ugly and should not be looked at. However, from this "landing page" one can navigate to `/cv_page1` and `cv_page2` to show the two nicely looking CV pages.
